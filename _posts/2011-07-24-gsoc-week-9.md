title: GSoC, Week 9

Week 9 already....? Also, my internet connection is down, so this post is a
little later than I planned....

So there was some progress this week. A lot of it was in doing the math for the
linearization process. Linearization is normally easy, but when dealing with
dependent quantities becomes more complicated. It requires treating the
dependent quantities as functions of the independent quantities, then taking
partial derivatives. It ends up being simplest (that is the current theory at
least) when using the chain rule; this was done by hand in order to ease the
work done by SymPy's routines. These expressions can get quite large, so
minimizing the buildup of expression size is important. Or, to put it another
way, we figured out the best way to operate on smaller chunks of expressions,
rather than larger ones, and then combine them afterwards, minimizing the size
of some of the expressions which have to be dealt with.

In our lab at UC Davis, one of the big projects currently is studying bicycle
dynamics. A paper was written in 2007 which sought to provide
benchmark/reference values to validate models of the bicycle against: J.P
Meijaard, Jim M Papadopoulos, Andy Ruina and A.L Schwab. Linearized dynamics
equations for the balance and steer of a bicycle: a benchmark and review.
Proceedings of The Royal Society (2007) 463, 1955-1982 doi:
10.1098/rspa.2007.1857 . One of the goals for PyDy this year was to be able to
generate the full nonlinear equations for the bicycle, and the linear equations
for comparison of eigenvalues using the reference values. Well, it looks like
my code can do that successfully now:

The code at the bottom of the post calculates the "A" matrix, and writes a few
eigenvalues out. You can compare them to those presented in the paper. There
are still 2 issues left to investigate as part of the linearization process,
there is pretty printing, latex printing, and finally code output and all of
the functionality will be "done". There is also still lots of documentation to
write...

One other issue, that is proving to be somewhat serious, is the speed of the
code. The execution time of the code is usually not too terrible, and if it
does get bad, turning of Vector's auto simplification (Vector.simp = False)
usually helps. The linearization can also be kinda slow, but not overwhelmingly
so. What seems to really be an issue is both printing (to screen or file) and
substituting. The expressions get fairly big (I think the forcing term for the
bicycle is on the order of 1MB when in Ascii form) so I'm not completely
unhappy or surprised about the printing issue. I am more unhappy about the
substitution being slow. Right now I'm using .subs(), and it seems to take a
few minutes. I've also tried .evalf(subs=dict) and lambdify, but .evalf hits a
maximum recursion depth error, and I'm getting a syntax error with lambdify (it
actually looks like this is due to the use of unknown functions; I'm sure I can
solve this somehow).

Use the pydy-pull-funcderiv branch; that's the current branch. Some pushes have
been forced in, so beware....sorry. Also, Brian Granger's code got pulled in,
so I'll be defining 'dynamic symbols' as undefined functions of time. My
branches need a little work to get them organized and unified again.
